# Network_Centrality_analysis_and_KO-simulation
These scripts were developed by Julie Duboscq and Xu Zhihong

this is the workflow for the study on the relationship between social network centrality and parasitism intensity and the impact of missing age-sex classes in the network on this relationship in Japanese macaques

it contains a collection of scripts to 1/ calculate indices from raw data, e.g. dominance ranks from aggression data, network contrality measures from a social proximity matrix and parasite richness from EPG data from 3 nematode species; 2/ run glmms testing the relationship between network centralities and parasite intensity (as measured by EPG) of 3 nematode species, 1 set of glmms with data from the whole group (whole-group data), 1 with data from the adult females only (adult female data) and 1 with data from juveniles only (juvenile data); 3/ run randomisations to test whether uncovered patterns are due to chance or not; 4/ run simulations to test the effect of the removal of certain types of individuals from the network on the relationship between centrality and parasite intensity; 5/ plot the results
